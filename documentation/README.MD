### Requirements

Various diagrams and reports documenting the progression of the project -- from 
proposal to final product and report.

| Major Requirement    | Description | Status | Notes * | 
|----------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Forward and backward motion. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 2 | Turns while moving forward and backward. | :heavy_check_mark: * | Robot performs turn on spot.
| 3 | Forward wall sensors. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 4 / 4.1| Lateral wall sensors, course correction. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 5 / 5.1-5.2| Objective detecting in 180&deg; forward arc.| :heavy_check_mark: * | Field of view is 10&deg;.
| 6 / 6.1-6.3| Autonomous movement, wall avoidance. | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| 7 / 7.1-7.6| Autonomous navigation, autonomous path finding, position monitoring. | :heavy_check_mark: * | GPS used; absolute position of robot in maze.
| 8 / 8.1-8.4 | Autonomous objective securing, autonomous objective transportation. | :heavy_check_mark: * | Objective must be secured manually, by a human operator.

| Additional Achievements | Description | Status | Notes * |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
|  A1  | Random maze generation. | :heavy_check_mark: | We can generate mazes of variable sizes and aspect ratios.
|  A2  | Robot is generalizable to any maze; it goes in blind (with a few assumptions). | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
|  A3  | Robot can be completely controlled manually. | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
